# Ferdium recipe for Nextcloud News

Nextcloud Deck is a kanban style organization tool aimed at personal planning and project organization for teams integrated with Nextcloud.

To add Nextcloud Deck service to Ferdium, Nextcloud server address should be provided in the field "Custom server".

## Credits

This recipe is based on [`recipe-nextcloud-tasks`](https://github.com/meetfranz/recipe-nextcloud-tasks).

Icon was sourced from <https://github.com/nextcloud/deck/tree/main/img> (`deck.svg`, as `favicon.svg` seems to be malformed currently) and I added the rounded blue square in the background. If someone can find or make an icon that better matches the other Nextcloud services, please do.
